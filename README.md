# Todo App in Angular (v2)

A simple and user-friendly Todo application built with Angular. This app helps you manage your daily tasks with ease by allowing you to add new tasks, edit existing ones, mark tasks as completed or pending, and search/filter through your list. Tasks are saved in your browser’s local storage, so your data persists between sessions.

**This is version 2 of my Todo app. You can check out the previous version [here](https://github.com/aimendurrani/Todo-App).**

## Concepts Covered

* **Angular Components & Data Binding** — Building UI with components, using property and event binding (`[(ngModel)]`, `(click)`) for interaction.
* **TypeScript Interfaces** — Defining `Task` interface for better type safety and code clarity.
* **Component Lifecycle** — Using `ngOnInit` to initialize data when the component loads.
* **Filtering and Searching** — Using JavaScript array methods like `filter` and `includes` to implement search and filter functionality.
* **Conditional Rendering** — Displaying or hiding elements dynamically with Angular directives such as `*ngIf` and `*ngFor`.
* **Local Storage** — Saving tasks in browser storage so data persists across page refreshes.
* **State Management** — Managing app state via variables for tasks, editing, and user input.
* **Event Handling** — Responding to user actions like clicks and key presses to update the task list.
